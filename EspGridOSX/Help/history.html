        <h1>EspGrid Version History</h1>
        
        <div>v0.50.3 fixed inter-thread problem in EspCodeShare by adding a lock; various tiny fixes/changes</div>
        <div>v0.50.2 EspKeyValueController now broadcasts only when a node is the authority for a value, OR the authority for a value hasn't been heard from (time since beacon) in more than 10 seconds</div>
        <div>v0.50.1 some pruning of log statements; beacons (internal protocol) now broadcast in a random pattern (1-5s)</div>
        <div>v0.50.0 two major changes to synchronization: (a) using monotonic, epochless machine clock instead of gettimeofday and (b) each node translates monotonic, epochless machine time of each other peer into its own frame, instead of maintaining a shared, synchronized clock.</div>
        <div>v0.49 Linux/GNUstep port; request-driven messages to flexible host/ports; all UDP sent from meaningful ports; cross-thread notification mechanism for chat/log posting; general refactoring</div>
        <div>v0.48 critical bug fix in mode 1 clock synchronization</div>
        <div>v0.47 request-driven /clock/offset/* /esp/tempo/* messages (cf. TOPLAP discussions), EspClock for SuperCollider</div>
        <div>v0.46 local and remote ports for EspBridge are configurable (in GUI and via OSC)</div>
        <div>v0.45 changes to public protocol /esp/clock and /esp/beat messages, command line help, complete OSC controls</div>
        <div>v0.44 basic WAN bridge in private protocol, initial command line edition "espgridd"</div>
        <div>v0.43 addition of continuous (slow) "/esp/clock [adjustedTime] [adjustment]" messages to public protocol</div>
        <div>v0.42 reorganization of EspClock algorithms, flux measurement, plus other bug fixes</div>
        <div>v0.41 various bug fixes - improved stability relative to 0.40</div>
        <div>v0.40 reference broadcast synchronization algorithm added, plus other optimizations</div>
        <div>v0.39 addition of system for switching synchronization algorithms, race-only algorithm added</div>
        <div>v0.37-38 experiments with different EspClock algorithms</div>
        <div>v0.36 using moving average of specific latency in EspClock/EspPeerList, lock mechanism in EspClock (constrains sync adjustments to 1ms or less), more protection against corrupt transmissions, expanded unit testing</div>
        <div>v0.35 fixed nasty bug in EspClock, reduced CPU load from EspQueue, reduced bandwidth of EspKeyValueController</div>
        <div>v0.34 reorganization of code sharing to support long (>MTU) code fragments; established unit testing for some classes</div>
        <div>v0.33 various protections against malformed messages in EspOsc</div>
        <div>v0.32 added integrated help system and app icon (the latter contributed by Kearon Roy Taylor)</div>
        <div>v0.31 broadcast of immediate and scheduled arbitrary OSC messages (with or without timestamps included in the messages) (EspMessage/EspQueue)</div>
        <div>v0.30 various small changes: clock system only warns of mismatched versions once, peers are deleted when no beacon for 2 mins, OSC control of EspBeat propagates over network properly</div>
        <div>v0.29 fixed oversight in 0.28 that broke code sharing system</div>
        <div>v0.28 refinements to code in EspBeat.m (including smooth on-the-fly tempo changes)</div>
        <div>v0.27 designated port for PD; protect against divide by 0 in tempo; fixed bug where incomplete "custom application connection" in Preferences crashes app</div>
        <div>v0.26 shift to tab view in Mac OS X GUI, implementation of log window separate from chat window</div>
        <div>v0.25 EspCodeShare: all entries requestable/copyable, system to autocopy requested deliveries</div>
        <div>v0.24 EspPeerList keeps track of how long since last communication with each peer, updates status</div>
        <div>v0.23 ability to pick out specific pieces of shared code and grab them in EspCodeShare</div>
        <div>v0.22 major overhaul of EspKeyValueController; first iPad version; begun to abandon Cocoa bindings</div>
        <div>v0.21 EspPost system added for better handling of different types of "log" messages</div>
        <div>v0.20 clock algorithm adjusts for peer-specific latency; other small changes</div>
        <div>v0.19 name change to EspGrid, peer list includes self info</div>
        <div>v0.18 OSC backdoor for hacked miniAudicle (add/replace shred in miniAudicle shares code)</div>
        <div>v0.17 OSC control of EspBeat and OSC "back door" for EspChat</div>
        <div>v0.16 basic EspCodeShare mechanisms via clipboard; shared control of EspBeat cyclelength</div>
        <div>v0.15 crude shared control of EspBeat on the basis of EspKeyValueController</div>
        <div>v0.14 addition of EspKeyValueController (network sharing of variables, KVC/KVO compliant)</div>
        <div>v0.13 basic EspBeat completed without user/net control</div>
        <div>v0.12 removed Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) and fixed compatibility with OS X 10.6</div>
        <div>v0.11 beacon is transmitted 19 times in first 5 seconds (every 250ms) before reducing to 5s period</div>
        <div>v0.10 replaced public domain AsyncUdpSocket with new EspSocket and UdpSend classes</div>
        <div>v0.09 added first version of UDP burst system</div>
        <div>v0.08 added Preferences panel</div>
